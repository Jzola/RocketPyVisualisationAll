The first simulation uses time and location based forecast data (identical to original setting)
You can use either the original file all_inputs.csv for this, or Env1_all_inputs

The second simulation uses the following code to get some different wind data. Use Env2_all_inputs as the input file. 
NOTE: The change in wind and possibly the rail length have made a big difference to the flight time so there are a lot more trajectory points

#Wind U is wind from east, wind_v is wind from north. A negative number indicates the wind is coming from opposite direction
#Default value has easterly wind at 5m/s at 0 distance, and 10m/s at  1km. wind_u=[(0, 5), (1000, 10)]

EnvCA.setAtmosphericModel(
    type="CustomAtmosphere",
    pressure=None, # standard atmospheric pressure is 101325 Pa
    temperature=300, #temperature is in Kelvins
    wind_u=[(0, 5), (1000, 10)],
    wind_v=[(0, -2), (500, 3), (1600, 2)],
)

The third simulation has the following setup (reversed east and north values.) Use Env3_all_inputs
EnvCA2 = Environment(railLength=8)
EnvCA2.setAtmosphericModel(
    type="CustomAtmosphere",
    pressure=None, # standard atmospheric pressure is 101325 Pa
    temperature=300, #temperature is in Kelvins
    wind_u=[(0, -2), (500, 3), (1600, 2)],
    wind_v=[(0, 5), (1000, 10)],
)
